#### TL;DR

When testing, mock `CSSTransition` by adding the class(es) that `CSSTransition` would have added to your component, like so:

```jsx
addClass(content.getDOMNode(), "transitionClass-enter-done")
// read more to find out about addClass
```

#### Let's go!

import ExhibitA from "../components/2020-05-23-how-to-mock-csstransition/ExhibitA"

I assume you're here because you've used `CSSTransition` in a component you'd like to test, but you don't want the test to wait for the animation to complete.

For example, this silly little component changes the opacity of its text when you hover over it:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"
import { CSSTransition } from "react-transition-group"
import styled from "styled-components"

const appearDuration = 300
export const transitionClass = "hover"

const ExhibitA = () => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false)

  return (
    <CSSTransition
      in={isHovered}
      timeout={appearDuration}
      classNames={transitionClass}
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
    >
      <StyledText data-testid="hovered-content">
        Hover me to change opacity
      </StyledText>
    </CSSTransition>
  )
}

export default ExhibitA

const StyledText = styled.span`
  opacity: 0.5;
  &.${transitionClass}-enter-done {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  transition: opacity ${appearDuration}ms ease;
`
```

Here's the component, rendered:

<ExhibitA />

Notice that when the transition is complete, the `CSSTransition` component adds a class `${transitionClass}-enter-done` to its child component. This is effectively the main output of `CSSTransition` &mdash; new classes.

So, when you're testing your component you can mock how `CSSTransition` works by simply adding/removing these classes to your component. The package [dom-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-helpers) has a handy function `addClass` that does exactly what it sounds like it does &mdash; adds a class to a DOM node.

If I'm using Jest/Enzyme my test would look something like:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { mount } from "enzyme"
import addClass from "dom-helpers/addClass"
import ExhibitA, { transitionClass } from "../ExhibitA"

describe("<ExhibitA />", () => {
  it("increases the opacity when hovered", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(<ExhibitA />)
    const content = wrapper.find("[data-testid='hovered-content']")
    // this line effectively mocks CSSTransition
    addClass(content.getDOMNode(), `${transitionClass}-enter-done`)
    // after this^ point you can make whatever assertions you needed to make
    const containerStyle = content.style
    expect(containerStyle).to.have.property("opacity", "1")
  })
})
```

This is a bit of a contrived example, but hopefully I made the point clear!
